    "PROMPT": "High-end, ultra-realistic personal portrait of the individual in the provided photo, preserving their unique facial features, apparent age, gender, skin tone, hair, eyes, and expression. Negatives: No distortion of features, no changes in age or gender, no plastic-like skin, no invented clothing (except as fallback), no extra or missing fingers, no noise, no text or watermarks.

Her hair is intensely backlit, creating a luminous golden halo that contrasts sharply with the dark background.\nExpression and pose: She turns her face toward the camera, with a direct gaze partially veiled by shadows. Her mouth is slightly open, adding an expressive and intimate tone to the image.
